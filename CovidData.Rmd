```{r, eval=FALSE}
CovidData <- read.csv("C:/Users/Andrea/Desktop/Femmeshacks/country_wise_latest.csv", header = TRUE)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(CovidData)
```

To keep data from being unreadable, filter file with data and use data frame instead.

```{r}
CovidData %>% filter(New.cases > 5000)
Covid.df <- data.frame(CovidData %>% filter(New.cases > 1000))
ggplot(data = Covid.df) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = New.cases, y = WHO.Region, color = Country.Region )) + labs(title = "New Cases by Country and WHO Region")
```


```{r}
CovidData %>% filter(Confirmed > 5000)
Covid.df <- data.frame(CovidData %>% filter(New.cases > 1000))
ggplot(data = Covid.df) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = New.cases, y = X1.week...increase, color = Country.Region )) + labs(title = "New Cases and Increase in week by Country")
```


```{r}
Covid.df <- data.frame(CovidData %>% filter(New.cases > 4000))
ggplot((data = Covid.df), aes(x = Country.Region, y = New.cases)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + labs(title = "New Cases Per Country")
```

To be able to set x and y aesthetic, must identify geom_bar stat as identity, otherwise can only pick one.
